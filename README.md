# Array Manipulation Project in JavaScript

This project is a series of practical exercises focused on array manipulation in JavaScript. The goal is to practice using key array methods such as `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `find`, `reduce`, `some`, `every`, and `sort`. These exercises are designed to deepen your understanding of how to work with arrays effectively, especially when it comes to transforming, filtering, and querying data.

Each exercise is tested using the **Jest** testing framework to ensure that the implemented functions behave as expected. The project also includes a set of mock data in JSON format for running the tests.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, make sure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
This command will execute all the tests defined in the test/ folder, verifying that all functions perform as required.

## Project goal

The main objective of this project is to provide hands-on practice with essential JavaScript array methods. These methods are fundamental for working with collections of data and are frequently used in real-world JavaScript applications. By completing these exercises, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to:

- Transform arrays with map.
- Filter arrays using filter.
- Find specific elements with find.
- Accumulate values using reduce.
- Check conditions in arrays with some and every.
- Sort arrays using sort.
